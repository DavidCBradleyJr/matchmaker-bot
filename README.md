## 🔧 Setup & Usage

1. **Invite the Bot**
   - Use the bot’s invite link and grant it the recommended permissions.

2. **Choose an LFG Channel**
   - After adding the bot, set a channel where `/lfg` ads will appear.
   - Command (server owner/admin only):  
     ```
     /lfg setchannel #lfg
     ```
   - The bot will post all new LFG ads into this channel.

3. **Create an LFG Ad**
   - Members can post with:  
     ```
     /lfg post game:<game_name> notes:<your_message>
     ```
   - Example:  
     ```
     /lfg post game:"Valorant" notes:"Need 2 for ranked, voice chat preferred"
     ```

4. **Responding to an LFG Ad**
   - Each ad includes a “Connect” button.
   - Clicking the button connects you privately with the original poster (via DM).

## 🚀 Future Features (Planned)

We’re building the foundation now, but here are features we’re considering for the future:

- **Cross-Server Matchmaking Queue (Premium Feature)**  
  - Instead of only posting ads in one server, players could enter a global queue that matches them with others across all servers the bot is in.

- **Ad Expiry System**  
  - Ads automatically expire after a set time (e.g., 1–2 hours) to keep channels clean.

- **Player Profiles**  
  - Store preferences (favorite games, roles, time zones) so users don’t need to re-type every time.

- **Premium Tier Ideas**  
  - Priority placement in LFG feeds.  
  - Advanced matchmaking filters (e.g., region, rank).  
  - Private global queue access.

## 📌 Notes for Server Owners
- Make sure to **set the LFG channel** after inviting the bot, otherwise ads won’t be visible.  
- The bot only posts ads into the chosen channel — it won’t clutter other areas of your server.  
- Keep in mind that some features (like global matchmaking) are planned but not yet live.
